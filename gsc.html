				<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The goal of the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (CPAC) 
						project is to make cutting edge analyses of very large neuroimaging datasets 
						accessible to researchers from a variety of backgrounds. This is accomplished 
						through providing simplified user interfaces that permit processing pipelines to 
						be easily constructed and executed on high performance computing 
						infrastructures.  At its core, CPAC uses NIPYPE (http://nipy.org/nipype) to link 
						together functions from popular open source neuroimaging analysis software 
						packages such as (AFNI, FSL, ANTS, etc...) into processing pipelines that are 
						then executed in parallel on high performance computing architectures such as 
						clusters and multicore systems.  CPAC currently implements state-of-the-art 
						preprocessing and analysis strategies for functional magnetic resonance imaging 
						data (fMRI), but our goal is to extend it to other neurimaging modalities (e.g.  
						structural, diffusion, perfusion MRI) in the near future.<br><br>

						There are a variety of different ways to contribute to CPAC project including 
						improving the application infrastructure, adding new data analysis methods, 
						adding support for new neuroimaging technques, and developing better 
						visualizations for the data. We list a few ideas for each of these areas below, 
						but are also open to blue sky projects that are outside of the areas we have 
						specified. We encourage involvement from individuals with a diversity of 
						backgrounds and skill levels.</p>

						<h4>Read in data from database using RESTful API</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>CPAC currently assumes that all of the input data is available on the local filesystem, and determines
              data locations using globbing. This project would enhance CPAC capabilities by allowing it to retrieve data locations and the data itself
              from neuroinformatics infrastructures using a RESTful interface. The RESTful API will be provided by us.

					<h3>Data Analysis</h3>

						<h4>Supervised machine learning techniques to characterize clinical data.</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>For each participant in a neuroimaging study we typically have several labels corresponding to things like
              whether or not they suffer from a disorder, sex, age, and others. The goal of this project is to implement machine learning algorithms to learn
              classifiers capable of prediciting the label from derivatives calculated from the neuroimaging data. For example, we might use grey matter density
              measures extracted from structural scans to predict age or sex.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong>Supervised machine learning workflow that can work with any statistical derivative that CPAC generates.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong>Python, machine learning libraries such as scikit.learn and machine learning algorithms.</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> medium to high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: Cameron Craddock, Steven Giavasis, Danny Clark</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Add any new analysis to CPAC - for more advanced / neuroimaging initiates</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>CPAC includes many different analyses that are aimed at identifying relationships between brain function and structure
              and different individual qualities or traits. For example we may be interested in determining how brain activity in a particular brain region correlates
              with an individuals ability to read. CPAC has several analysis already implemented, but we would like to have more. This would be a great opportunity for
              a data-analysis expert to apply their favorite algorithm to neuroimaging data.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong>Group level analysis that can be performed on any statistical derivative that CPAC genearates.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong>Python, statistical libraries such as Pandas, data analysis</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong>high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: Cameron Craddock, Steven Giavasis, Danny Clark</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Performance optimization of existing algorithms used to analyze neuroimaging data</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>Performing data analyses on data from a thousand or more observations can take a long time. Particularly when each
              one of those observations contains tens of thousands of features. The goal of this project is to refactor current CPAC analaysis pipelines to make them 
              much more efficient.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong>Optimized code that can obtain same results as original results, in reduced time or with less memory.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong>python optimization, numerical optimization</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong>medium, high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
					
					<h3>Visualization</h3>
						<h4>Data visualization tools for graphs, automated image generation (http://circos.ca/), embedded pdfs</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> 2-3 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> 1-2 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> short list</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice, medium, high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Webapp for exploring brain function and anatomy (see neurosynth)</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> 2-3 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> 1-2 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> short list</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice, medium, high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Brain-pipeline interaction data-vis</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> 2-3 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> 1-2 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> short list</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice, medium, high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
					
					<h3>Neuroscience</h3>
						<h4>Add processing and analysis workflows for an usupported imaging modality</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>CPAC currently supports MRI and resting state fMRI data, but we would like for 
              it to support much more. Example modalities that are on our todo lists are diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion
              weighted imaging (ASL), myelin imaging, susceptibility weighted imaging and more. For most of these modalities this project
              would involve implementing preprocessing, calculating statistical derivatives from the data (i.e. FA, ADC for DTI, or mean CBF for perfusion),
              and making sure that the derivatives can work with the existing analysis algorithms.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong>Workflows to perform preprocessing, calculate derivatiaves, and perform group level analyses.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong>Python, neuroimaging software tools (e.g. dipy for DTI), and basic knowledge of imaging modality to be addressed.</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong>medium to high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: Cameron Craddock, Steve Giavasis, Danny Clark</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>System to receive and processing neuroimaging data in real-time</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>Several emergent neuroimging experimental techniques rely on the ability to analyze the neuroimaging data as it is being acquired. 
              For example, in real-time fMRI, brain activity is decoded from fMRI data as it is being collected and can be used to control a computer interface. We currently have software
              on the MRI scanner that will export fMRI data over a TCP/IP connection. This project would involve developing the software that receives the data, and uses other existing
              neuroimaging analysis software packages to analyze the data in real-time.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong>Software that can receive and analyze neuroimaging data in real-time.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> Python, network programming</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> can accomodate students from novice to high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: Cameron Craddock, Steven Giavasis</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
