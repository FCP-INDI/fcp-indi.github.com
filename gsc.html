				<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The goal of the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (CPAC) 
						project is to make cutting edge analyses of very large neuroimaging datasets 
						accessible to researchers from a variety of backgrounds. This is accomplished 
						through providing simplified user interfaces that permit processing pipelines to 
						be easily constructed and executed on high performance computing 
						infrastructures.  At its core, CPAC uses NIPYPE (http://nipy.org/nipype) to link 
						together functions from popular open source neuroimaging analysis software 
						packages such as (AFNI, FSL, ANTS, etc...) into processing pipelines that are 
						then executed in parallel on high performance computing architectures such as 
						clusters and multicore systems.  CPAC currently implements state-of-the-art 
						preprocessing and analysis strategies for functional magnetic resonance imaging 
						data (fMRI), but our goal is to extend it to other neurimaging modalities (e.g.  
						structural, diffusion, perfusion MRI) in the near future.<br><br>

						There are a variety of different ways to contribute to CPAC project including 
						improving the application infrastructure, adding new data analysis methods, 
						adding support for new neuroimaging technques, and developing better 
						visualizations for the data. We list a few ideas for each of these areas below, 
						but are also open to blue sky projects that are outside of the areas we have 
						specified. We encourage involvement from individuals with a diversity of 
						backgrounds and skill levels.</p>

				<h2>Idea List</h2>
					<h3>Basic Application Development (Infrastructure)</h3>

						<h4>Real-time dashboard for currently executing analyses</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> CPAC can run an extensive array of neuroimaging pipelines, which contain several steps. At present, a log file is kept of the steps executed as well as any standard error and output, which can be difficult to use in keeping track of all the steps being executed. The goal of this project would be to create a more elegant status page that would allow users to better monitor the execution of analyses.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> An html page that indicates information about each step including the status (e.g., running/error/done), execution time, possible output, etc. This page would potentially use javascript to update the status of the analyses in real-time.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> python, html, css, and javascript</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice or medium</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> Steve Giavasis and Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Read in data from database using RESTful API</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> 2-3 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> 1-2 sentences</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> short list</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice, medium, high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong></li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Revamp and Revitalize our GUI for creating analysis pipelines</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> CPAC was initially created as a command-line interface with a GUI that wraps around this interface. We have begun to encounter issues with our current GUI backend (wxPython) and have found that it is not very extensible to our needs, has lags in load time, and is difficult to install on certain systems. Here, we would be looking to move our current GUI interface to another system.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> Create a new GUI interface to replace the current wxPython-based one as well as introduce new features to the GUI that would make it easier to interface with the command-line interface.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> short list</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> medium or high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> Steve Giavasis and Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Learn how to make basic installation packages using Docker, PIP, or easy_install</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> Like many open-source tools, CPAC has several dependences. Currently, a more manual install process is required to install CPAC and all its prerequisite tools. The goal would be to put together a package installer for CPAC that makes it easier for users to get up and running.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> A simple installer using Docker, PIP, or easy_install that could be run by a user with minimal hassle to install CPAC and its dependencies.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> short list</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> Steve Giavasis and Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>

					<h3>Visualization</h3>
						<h4>Data visualization tools for the Connectome</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> The brain's connectome is complex and multidimensional. We need to apply the lastest in data visualization tools, like <a href="http://circos.ca/">circos</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org">d3</a> and 3D-embedded pdfs to graphically communicate our results. Help us modernize the standards in scientific publishing and data interaction software. This project provides exposure to the challenges in neuroimaging research, and a way to explore visualization tools that are available as free & open software.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> A software package which automates visual feedback for scientists and integrates with existing communcation media.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> Basic python, or javascript</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong>Aimi Watanabe</li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Webapp for exploring brain function and anatomy</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> <a href="http://neurosynth.org">Neurosynth</a> is a product of neuroimaging scientists interested in the power of data exploration. As a open source alternative of <a href="http://www.brainmap.org">The BrainMap Project</a>, neurosynth compiles previous publications in cognitive neuroscience to extract themes and topics through neuro-linguistic programming. Data from these papers are also collected, thereby linking brain-behavior relationships within the overarching database. Likewise, you can create your own webapp to help scientists and interested citizens understand the interaction of mind and body. </li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> A robust web-application for data exploration.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> Basic javascript, html, & css</li>
