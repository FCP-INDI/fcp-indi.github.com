				<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The goal of the <a href="fcp-indi.github.io"> Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (CPAC)</a> 
						project is to make cutting edge analyses of very large neuroimaging datasets 
						accessible to researchers from a variety of backgrounds. This is accomplished 
						through providing simplified user interfaces that permit processing pipelines to 
						be easily constructed and executed on high performance computing 
						infrastructures.  At its core, CPAC uses <a href="http://nipy.org/nipype">Nipype </a>to link 
						together functions from popular open source neuroimaging analysis software 
						packages (e.g. <a href="afni.nim.nih.org">AFNI</a>, <a href="fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki">FSL</a>, <a href="http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/">ANTS</a>, etc...) into processing pipelines that are 
						then executed in parallel on high performance computing architectures such as 
						clusters and multicore systems.  CPAC currently implements state-of-the-art 
						preprocessing and analysis strategies for functional magnetic resonance imaging 
						data (fMRI), but our goal is to extend it to other neurimaging modalities (e.g.  
						structural, diffusion, perfusion MRI) in the near future.<br><br>

						There are a variety of different ways to contribute to CPAC project including 
						improving the application infrastructure, adding new data analysis methods, 
						adding support for new neuroimaging technques, and developing better 
						visualizations for the data. We list a few ideas for each of these areas below, 
						but are also open to blue sky projects that are outside of the areas we have 
						specified. We encourage involvement from individuals with a diversity of 
						backgrounds and skill levels.</p>

				<h2>Idea List</h2>
					<h3>Basic Application Development (Infrastructure)</h3>

						<h4>Real-time dashboard for currently executing analyses</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> CPAC can run an extensive array of neuroimaging pipelines, which contain several steps. At present, a log file is kept of the steps executed as well as any standard error and output, which can be difficult to use in keeping track of all the steps being executed. The goal of this project would be to create a more elegant status page that would allow users to better monitor the execution of analyses.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> An html page that indicates information about each step including the status (e.g., running/error/done), execution time, possible output, etc. This page would potentially use javascript to update the status of the analyses in real-time.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> Python, html, css, and javascript</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> novice or medium</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> Steve Giavasis and Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>
							<h4>Read in data from database using RESTful API</h4>
								<p><ul>
								<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong>CPAC currently assumes that all of the input data is available on the local filesystem, and determines
	              data locations using globbing. This project would enhance CPAC capabilities by allowing it to retrieve data locations and the data itself
	              from neuroinformatics infrastructures using a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming">RESTful interface</a>. The RESTful API will be provided by us.
								<li><strong>Expected results: </strong>Ability to read in data locations and data from a RESTful API.</li>
								<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong>Python, RESTful APIs</li>
								<li><strong>Skill level: </strong> novice, medium</li>
								<li><strong>Mentor: </strong>Steven Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
								</ul></p>
						<h4>Revamp and Revitalize our GUI for creating analysis pipelines</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong> CPAC was initially created as a command-line interface with a GUI that wraps around this interface. We have begun to encounter issues with our current GUI backend (<a href="http://wxpython.org">wxPython</a>) and have found that it is not very extensible to our needs, has lags in load time, and is difficult to install on certain systems. Here, we would be looking to move our current GUI interface to another system.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results: </strong> Create a new GUI interface to replace the current wxPython-based one as well as introduce new features to the GUI that would make it easier to interface with the command-line interface.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong> Familiarity with gui-design</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level: </strong> novice to high</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: </strong> Steve Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>Make basic installation packages using Docker, PIP, or easy_install</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong> Like many open-source tools, CPAC has several dependences. Currently, a more manual install process is required to install CPAC and all its prerequisite tools. The goal would be to put together a package installer for CPAC that makes it easier for users to get up and running.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results: </strong> A simple installer using Docker, PIP, or easy_install that could be run by a user with minimal hassle to install CPAC and its dependencies.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong> Python</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level: </strong> novice</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: </strong> Steve Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>

					<h3>Data Analysis</h3>

					<h4>Supervised machine learning techniques to characterize clinical data.</h4>
						<p><ul>
						<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong>For each participant in a neuroimaging study we typically have several labels corresponding to things like
            whether or not they suffer from a disorder, sex, age, and others. The goal of this project is to implement machine learning algorithms to learn
            classifiers capable of prediciting the label from derivatives calculated from the neuroimaging data. For example, we might use grey matter density
            measures extracted from structural scans to predict age or sex.</li>
						<li><strong>Expected results: </strong>Supervised machine learning workflow that can work with any statistical derivative that CPAC generates.</li>
						<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong>Python, machine learning libraries such as <a href="http://scikit-learn.org">scikit.learn</a> and machine learning algorithms.</li>
						<li><strong>Skill level: </strong>medium to high</li>
						<li><strong>Mentor: </strong>Cameron Craddock, Steven Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
						</ul></p>
					<h4>Add any new analysis to CPAC - for more advanced / neuroimaging initiates</h4>
						<p><ul>
						<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong>CPAC includes many different analyses that are aimed at identifying relationships between brain function and structure
            and different individual qualities or traits. For example we may be interested in determining how brain activity in a particular brain region correlates
            with an individuals ability to read. CPAC has several analysis already implemented, but we would like to have more. This would be a great opportunity for
            a data-analysis expert to apply their favorite algorithm to neuroimaging data.</li>
						<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> Group level analysis that can be performed on any statistical derivative that CPAC genearates.</li>
						<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> Python, statistical libraries such as <a href="pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a>, data analysis</li>
						<li><strong>Skill level:</strong> high</li>
						<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> Cameron Craddock, Steven Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
						</ul></p>
					<h4>Performance optimization of existing algorithms used to analyze neuroimaging data</h4>
						<p><ul>
						<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong>Performing data analyses on data from a thousand or more observations can take a long time. Particularly when each
            one of those observations contains tens of thousands of features. The goal of this project is to refactor current CPAC analaysis pipelines to make them 
            much more efficient.</li>
						<li><strong>Expected results: </strong>Optimized code that can obtain same results as original results, in reduced time or with less memory.</li>
						<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong>Python optimization, numerical optimization</li>
						<li><strong>Skill level: </strong>medium, high</li>
						<li><strong>Mentor: </strong>Steven Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
						</ul></p>
					
					<h3>Visualization</h3>
						<h4>Data visualization tools for the connectome</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong> The brain's connectome is complex and multidimensional. We need to apply the lastest in data visualization tools, like <a href="http://circos.ca/">circos</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org">d3</a> and 3D-embedded pdfs to graphically communicate our results. Help us modernize the standards in scientific publishing and data interaction software. This project provides exposure to the challenges in neuroimaging research, and a way to explore visualization tools that are available as free & open software.</li>
							<li><strong>Expected results: </strong> A software package which automates visual feedback for scientists and integrates with existing communcation media.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong> Basic Python, or javascript</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level: </strong> novice</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: </strong>Aimi Watanabe, Steve Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>WebApp for exploring brain function and anatomy</h4>
							<p><ul>
							<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong> <a href="http://neurosynth.org">Neurosynth</a> is a product of neuroimaging scientists interested in the power of data exploration. As a open source alternative of <a href="http://www.brainmap.org">The BrainMap Project</a>, neurosynth compiles previous publications in cognitive neuroscience to extract themes and topics through natural language processing. Data from these papers are also collected, thereby linking brain-behavior relationships within the overarching database. Likewise, you can create your own webapp to help scientists and interested citizens understand the interaction of mind and body. </li>
							<li><strong>Expected results:</strong> A robust web-application for data exploration.</li>
							<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite:</strong> Basic javascript, html, & css</li>
							<li><strong>Skill level: </strong> novice to medium</li>
							<li><strong>Mentor: </strong>Aimi Watanabe, Steve Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
							</ul></p>
					
					<h3>Neuroscience</h3>
					<h4>Add processing and analysis workflows for an usupported imaging modality</h4>
						<p><ul>
						<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong>CPAC currently supports MRI and resting state fMRI data, but we would like for 
            it to support much more. Example modalities that are on our todo lists are diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion
            weighted imaging (ASL), myelin imaging, susceptibility weighted imaging and more. For most of these modalities this project
            would involve implementing preprocessing, calculating statistical derivatives from the data (i.e. FA, ADC for DTI, or mean CBF for perfusion),
            and making sure that the derivatives can work with the existing analysis algorithms.</li>
						<li><strong>Expected results: </strong>Workflows to perform preprocessing, calculate derivatiaves, and perform group level analyses.</li>
						<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong>Python, neuroimaging software tools (e.g. dipy for DTI), and basic knowledge of imaging modality to be addressed.</li>
						<li><strong>Skill level: </strong>medium to high</li>
						<li><strong>Mentor: </strong>Cameron Craddock, Steve Giavasis, Daniel Clark</li>
						</ul></p>
					<h4>System to receive and processing neuroimaging data in real-time</h4>
						<p><ul>
						<li><strong>Brief explanation: </strong>Several emergent neuroimging experimental techniques rely on the ability to analyze the neuroimaging data as it is being acquired. 
            For example, in real-time fMRI, brain activity is decoded from fMRI data as it is being collected and can be used to control a computer interface. We currently have software
            on the MRI scanner that will export fMRI data over a TCP/IP connection. This project would involve developing the software that receives the data, and uses other existing
            neuroimaging analysis software packages to analyze the data in real-time.</li>
						<li><strong>Expected results: </strong>Software that can receive and analyze neuroimaging data in real-time.</li>
						<li><strong>Knowledge Prerequisite: </strong> Python, network programming</li>
						<li><strong>Skill level: </strong> can accomodate students from novice to high</li>
						<li><strong>Mentor: </strong>Cameron Craddock, Steven Giavasis, Dan Clark</li>
						</ul></p>
