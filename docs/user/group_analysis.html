<p>C-PAC uses <a class="reference external" href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide">FSL/FEAT</a> to compare findings across groups.  You can construct models using a subject list and a phenotype file, select derivatives to be predicted by the model, and define contrasts between conditions using either the GUI or a custom csv file.  Then FSL/FEAT will run a second-level <a class="reference external" href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide#Appendix_A:_Brief_Overview_of_GLM_Analysis">General Linear Model (GLM)</a> for you.</p>
<p>The following links provide an introduction to how groups are compared using FSL, as well as how to define contrasts:</p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<p>The following presentation also gives a good overview of the group analysis user interface:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cJVNeNSK8Uy8UTzN6mMG4YR5YLqnpV4HopqsKZbma5k/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=10000#slide=id.p">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cJVNeNSK8Uy8UTzN6mMG4YR5YLqnpV4HopqsKZbma5k/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=10000#slide=id.p</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The example files used in the presentation above are also available below for your perusal:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="_static/subject_list_group_analysis.txt">A Group-level Participant List</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="_static/example_phenotypic_file.csv">A Phenotype File</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As with subject list and pipeline configuration, there are two ways to set up FSL group analysis for C-PAC:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using a text editor (useful for remote servers where using the GUI is not possible or impractical)</li>
<li>Using the pipeline configuration interface in the GUI</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT (Dec 4, 2017):</strong></p>
<p>A concern has come to our attention regarding the behavior of the group analysis builder.</p>
<p>Specifically, when contrasts are entered into the YAML file or user interface for the model builder, their specific order may not be preserved when generating the .con file that is fed to FSL.</p>
<p>The contrasts are appropriately labeled in the .con file (located in the “model_files” folder). Associated outputs from FSL are correct as well. However, if you do not check the .con file, you can miss the change in order when interpreting your results.</p>
<p>Thus—if you have previously used the YAML or User Interface, we encourage you to verify that your contrast order in the .con file was not affected.</p>
<p>Contrasts entered into the model builder via the custom contrasts matrix option are not impacted by this issue.</p>
<p>This is not an intended behavior, and a patch fixing this behavior will be included in the upcoming release (version 1.0.3) by the end of next week. We apologize for this bug and are grateful to Sarah Thomas, PhD at the PediMIND Program for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<p>If anyone has any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us. If you think any analyses you have run may have been impacted by this issue, and you are not sure, let us know and we will help you determine if it has.</p>

<h2>Using a Text Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-text-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Similar to the pipeline and data configuration YAMLs for the pipeline and subject list specification steps, you can generate a group analysis configuration as a YAML.  An example of such a file can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/master/configs/config_fsl.yml">here</a>.

</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Participant List - [path]:</strong> Full path to a list of subjects to be included in the model. This should be a text file with one subject per line.  A list in this format containing all subjects run through CPAC was generated along with the main CPAC subject list (see the subject list in <cite>Overview</cite>). Another easy way to manually create this file is to copy the subjects column from your Regressor/EV spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Phenotype/EV File -[path]:</strong> Full path to a .csv file containing EV information for each subject. A file in this format (containing a single column listing all subjects run through CPAC) was generated along with the main CPAC subject list (see the phenotype file in <cite>Overview</cite>).  Levels for categorical variables in this file can be expressed as words (‘ADHD’/’TD’) or numerical values (0/1) depending on your preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Participant Column Name [text]:</strong> Name of the subjects column in your EV file.</li>
<li><strong>Model Setup - [checkboxes]:</strong> A list of EVs from your phenotype file will populate in this window. From here, you can select whether the EVs should be treated as categorical or if they should be demeaned (continuous/non-categorical EVs only). ‘MeanFD’ and ‘Measure Mean’ will also appear in this window automatically as options to be used as regressors that can be included in your model design. Note that the MeanFD and mean of measure values are automatically calculated and supplied by C-PAC via individual-level analysis. Measure mean is calculated using the mean signal from raw data rather than z-score data, which is then demeaned.  Also, MeanFD and mean of measure values are automatically demeaned prior to being inserted into the group analysis model.</li>
<li><strong>Design Matrix Formula - [Patsy formula]:</strong> Specify the formula to describe your model design. Essentially, including EVs in this formula inserts them into the model. The most basic format to include each EV you select would be ‘EV + EV + EV + ..’, etc. You can also select to include MeanFD, Measure_Mean, or an intercept here (by adding ‘ + Measure_Mean’, ‘ + MeanFD_&lt;Power/Jenkinson&gt;’ or ‘ + Intercept ‘ respectively). Note that when you add an intercept to your formula categorical variables will automatically be demeaned since this is a requirement for FLAME to run properly. This design formula is pre-generated for the user depending on the EVs in the phenotype file, but can be edited at any time. C-PAC uses the Python library Patsy to generate the design matrices, so more information on how to format your design formula for specific designs can be found here- <a class="reference external" href="https://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/formulas.html">Patsy formula documentation</a>.  If you have used R in the past, Patsy’s formula syntax should be familiar.</li>
<li><strong>Custom ROI Mean Mask (optional) - [path]:</strong> Use a binarized mask with one or more ROIs to add averages for those ROIs to the model as EVs.  Mask file must be in NifTI format.  These averages will be calculated using the raw data, rather than z-scored data, and will then be demeaned afterwards.</li>
<li><strong>Select Derivatives - [checkboxes]:</strong> Select which derivatives you would like to include when running group analysis. When including Dual Regression, make sure to correct your P-value for the number of maps you are comparing. When including Multiple Regression SCA, you must have more degrees of freedom (subjects) than there were time series.</li>
<li><strong>Mask for Means Calculation - [Group Mask, Individual Mask]:</strong> C-PAC can add the average voxel intensity for a derivative as an EV in the model.  If this average voxel intensity is present in the model, this menu allows you to select either a group-level or individual-level mask.  Otherwise, this menu can be ignored.</li>
<li><strong>Use z-score Standardized Derivatives - [True, False]:</strong> Run model on a z-score standardized version of individual-level outputs or the raw versions.</li>
<li><strong>Z Threshold - [decimal]:</strong> Only voxels with a Z-score higher than this value will be considered significant.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster Significance Threshold - [decimal]:</strong> Significance threshold (P-value) to use when doing cluster correction for multiple comparisons.</li>
<li><strong>Coding Scheme - [Treatment, Sum]:</strong> Select the encoding for your design matrix.  For more details, see Patsy’s pages on <a class="reference external" href="http://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/API-reference.html#patsy.Treatment">Treatment</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/API-reference.html#patsy.Sum">Sum</a> coding.</li>
<li><strong>Model Group Variances Separately - [Off, On]:</strong> Specify whether FSL should model the variance for each group separately. If this option is enabled, you must specify a grouping variable below.</li>
<li><strong>Grouping Variable - [text]:</strong> The name of the EV that should be used to group subjects when modeling variances. If you do not wish to model group variances separately, set this value to None.</li>
<li><strong>Sessions (Repeated Measures Only) - [dialogue: list of session names]:</strong> Enter the session names in your dataset that you wish to include within the same model (this is for repeated measures/  within-subject designs).  These will be the names listed as “unique_id” in  the original individual-level participant list, or the labels in the original data directories you marked as {session} while creating the C-PAC participant list.  Do not adjust your phenotype CSV- C-PAC will re-formulate it internally before passing it to FLAME.</li>
<li><strong>Series/Scans (Repeated Measures Only) - [dialogue: list of scan names]:</strong>  Enter the series names in your dataset that you wish to include within the same model (this is for repeated measure / within-subject designs).  These will be the labels listed under “rest:” in the original individual-level participant list, or the labels in the original data directories you marked as {series} while creating the C-PAC participant list.  Do not adjust your phenotype CSV- C-PAC will re-formulate it internally before passing it to FLAME.</li>

Contrasts are specified as formulas (e.g., C(diagnosis)[ADHD] + C(diagnosis)[TD]) = 0 for an ADHD &gt; TD contrast or age = 0 for an age &gt; 0 contrast).  Note that the way in which you define your model will determine which contrasts are capable of being run.  When you are done specifying contrasts check the contrasts you wish to run.</li>
