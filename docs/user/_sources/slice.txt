Slice Timing Correction 
-----------------------
Background
^^^^^^^^^^
Most fMRI images are created by combining multiple 2D slices into a single 3D volume. Slices are acquired one after another, either sequentially in ascending or descending order, or in an interleaved manner, such that every other slice is acquired in a first pass, and the remaining slices are aqcuired in a second pass. The time between the acquisition of the first and last slice depends on the TR used (e.g. 2.5 seconds for a TR of 2500ms). Slice timing correction acts to adjust the timecourse of voxels in each slice to account for these differences. This is done by interpolating the data in each slice to match the timing of a reference slice. Slice timing correction is necessary because many statistical models used for fMRI analysis assume that all voxels are measured simultaneously. As such, differences in acqusition time between slices can cause confounds.

Slice Timing Correction Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whenever possible, it is desirable to avoid using slice timing correction, as it can interact with motion correction to distort data (Poldrack et al., 2011). If one must apply slice timing correction, it should be done after motion correction to minimize these distortions. However, as the BOLD response is relatively sluggish, combining interleaved acquisitions with TR times shoter than 2000ms may obviate the need for slice timing correction, even for event-related designs (Poldrack et al., 2011).
