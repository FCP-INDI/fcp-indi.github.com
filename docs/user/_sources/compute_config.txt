Computer Settings
-----------------
::
	# True = Run on compute cluster
	# False = Run on non-cluster machine
	runOnGrid = False

	# Number of subjects to run simultaneously
	# This number depends on computing resources
	# Only applies when running on a non-cluster machine with multiple cores
	numSubjectsAtOnce = 2

	# Number of cores (non-cluster) or slots on a node (cluster) per subject
	# Slots are cores on a cluster node
	# This number depends on computing resources
	# Only applies when non-cluster machine has multiple cores or runOnGrid = True
	numCoresPerSubject = 2

Grid Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::
	# Options are 'SGE' (Sun Grid Engine) or 'PBS' (Portable Batch System)
	# Only applies when runOnGrid = True
	resourceManager = 'SGE'

	# Notes on setting up SGE for C-PAC
	#
	# SGE users must set up their parallel environment before running C-PAC.
	# A pipeline for each subject that needs preprocessing should be spawned
	# on single node of the cluster. To avoid I/O overhead, the pipeline should
	# only use the resources (cores) from that node. Users can enable this feature
	# on Sun Grid Engine by modifying their parallel environment.
	#
	# To create a new environment based on an existing one, follow these steps:
	# 1. List existing parallel environments
	#    $ qconf -spl
	# 2. View the settings for an existing environment
	#    $ qconf -sp environment_name
	#    
	#    Example output:
	#    pe_name            mpi
	#    slots              999
	#    user_lists         NONE
	#    xuser_lists        NONE
	#    start_proc_args    NONE
	#    stop_proc_args     NONE
	#    allocation_rule    $fill_up
	#    control_slaves     TRUE
	#    job_is_first_task  FALSE
	#    urgency_slots      min
	#    accounting_summary TRUE
	#
	# 3. Create a new environment based on an existing one
	#    $ qconf -sp environment_name > environment_name_cpac
	# 4. Edit the new environment and set allocation_rule to $pe_slots
	# 5. Add the new environment file to SGE
	#    $ qconf -Ap environment_name_cpac

	# Specify your SGE parallel environment
	parallelEnvironment = 'cpac'

	# Queue to use when running on an SGE cluster
	queue = 'all.q'
