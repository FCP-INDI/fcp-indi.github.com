Software Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workflows
"""""""""
A workflow accomplishes a particular processing task (e.g. functional preprocessing, scrubbing, nuisance correction). Each workflow can be turned on or off in :file:`config.yml`. A `complete list of workflows <http://fcp-indi.github.com/docs/developer/workflows/index.html>`_ can be found in the developer documentation.

Pipelines
"""""""""
A pipeline is a combination of workflows.

Strategies
""""""""""
A strategy is a set of preprocessing options. Specifically, a strategy is defined by segmentation thresholds, nuisance corrections, and scrubbing settings. Strategies are named based on their settings (e.g. :file:`_compcor_ncomponents_5_linear1.motion1.compcor1.CSF_0.98_GM_0.7_SCRUB_0.2_WM_0.98`). Names are constructed as follows:

* Number of principle components calculated by CompCor (if enabled)
* Nuisance corrections selected.
* CSF, Gray Matter, and White Matter segmentation thresholds.
* Scrubbing threshold (if enabled)

Derivatives
"""""""""""
Derivatives are the processed individual-level outputs of C-PAC.  These include the following connectivity measures:

* :doc:`Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) </sca>` - Analyze the connectivity between brain regions.
* :doc:`Dual Regression </dual_reg>` - Compare large-scale networks.
* :doc:`Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) </alff>` - Measure the power of slow fluctuations in brain activity.
* :doc:`Voxel-mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC) </vmhc>` - Investigate connectivity between hemispheres.
* :doc:`Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) </reho>` - Measure the similarity of activity patterns across neighboring voxels.
* :doc:`Network Centrality </centrality>` - Analyze the structure of functional networks.

C-PAC also makes it easy to :doc:`export timeseries information </tse>` from your data. You can choose to extract timeseries from regions of interest, and individual voxels.  

For group analysis, C-PAC utilizes the powerful statistical tools in `FSL <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT>`_ to :doc:`compare findings across groups </group_analysis>`.

Future derivatives (for which there are currently non-functioning interfaces in the alpha version) will include:

* :doc:`Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters (BASC) </basc>` - Quantify the stable characteristics of networks.
* :doc:`Connectome-wide Association Studies (CWAS) </cwas>` - Explore the relationship between patterns of functional connectivity and phenotypes.

Output Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Symbolic Links
""""""""""""""
C-PAC gives users the option (:file:`runSymbolicLinks : [1]` in :file:`config.yml`) of creating an output directory containing `symbolic links <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link>`_ to processed files. We strongly recommend this setting be enabled by all users, as it makes it much easier to navigate output files. The following schematic shows the structure of the resulting :file:`sym_links` directory:

.. figure:: /_images/symlink_structure.png

Pipeline and strategy folders are named as described above. 

File Descriptions
"""""""""""""""""
Preprocessed anatomical data from the Anatomical Preprocessing, Registration, and Segmentation workflows can be found in :file:`../scan/anat/` directory for each subject. The following diagram shows processing steps and standard output files for these workflows.

.. figure:: /_images/anat_prepro_schematic.png

Preprocessed functional data from the Functional Preprocessing workflow can be found in the :file:`../scan_<name>/func` directory for each subject. The following diagram shows processing steps and standard output files for this workflow.

.. figure:: /_images/functional_preprocessing.png

Derivative Outputs
""""""""""""""""""
Derivatives for each subject can be found in the :file:`../scan_<name>` directory of each subject. This folder also contains the outputs of the registration and segmentation workflows.

.. figure:: /_images/derivs_outputs.png

Within each derivative folder will be sub-folders for each set of frequency filters set in :file:`config.yml`, as well as a folder containing smoothed outputs.

Derivatives are output in both native space (:file:`*_img.nii.gz` and :file:`*_map.nii.gz` files), with values transformed to z-scores (:file:`*_Z_*.nii.gz`) and in standard space (:file:`*_to_standard.nii.gz`).
