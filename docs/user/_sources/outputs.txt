Software Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workflows
"""""""""
A workflow accomplishes a particular processing task (e.g. functional preprocessing, scrubbing, nuisance correction). Each workflow can be turned on or off in :file:`config.py`.

Pipelines
"""""""""
A pipeline is a combination of workflows. Each possible unique combination of workflows has been randomly assigned a name based on geographical locations in the United States. These pipeline names (e.g. :file:`pipeline_OakhurstCity`, :file:`pipeline_GraniteQuarry`) are consistent across C-PAC installs, and allow users to easily refer to a particular pipeline. 

Strategies
""""""""""
A strategy is a set of preprocessing options. Specifically, a strategy is defined by segmentation thresholds, nuisance corrections, and scrubbing settings. Strategies are named based on their settings (e.g. :file:`_compcor_ncomponents_5_linear1.motion1.compcor1.CSF_0.98_GM_0.7_SCRUB_0.2_WM_0.98`).

Derivatives
"""""""""""
Derivatives are the processed individual-level outputs of C-PAC (e.g. ReHo, VMHC, ALFF, Time Series)


Output Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Symbolic Links
""""""""""""""
C-PAC gives users the option (:file:`runSymbolicLinks = [1]` in :file:`config.py`) of creating an output directory containing `symbolic links <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link>`_ to processed files. We strongly recommend this setting be enabled by all users, as it makes it much easier to navigate output files. The following schematic shows the structure of the resulting :file:`sym_links` directory:
