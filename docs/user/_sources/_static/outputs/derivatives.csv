All Outputs
#TODO Find out the names given to derivatives in cpac_pipeline.py
<derivative>_zstd, The z-score standardized output for a derivative.
<derivative>_fisher_zstd - The z-score standardized output for a derivative using Fisher's z-score transformation.
output_means, A directory containing a series of nested sub-directories of the following form (with subdirectories representing optional steps only included if those steps were run): _scan_rest/_csf_threshold_<threshold>/_gm_threshold_<threshold>/_wm_threshold_<threshold>/<nuisance_regressors>/_hp_<high frequency cut-off>/_lp_<low frequency cut off>/.  At the lowest level of these subdirectories are text files that contain the average values for each derivative run.  These individual means are also aggregated into a single file of the form 'output_means_<subject name>.csv' in the individua subject output directory.
<derivative>_to_standard, A derivative transformed into MNI space.

Smoothing
<derivative>_smooth,  directory containing a series of nested sub-directories of the following form (with subdirectories representing optional steps only included if those steps were run): _scan_rest/_csf_threshold_<threshold>/_gm_threshold_<threshold>/_wm_threshold_<threshold>/<nuisance_regressors>/_hp_<high frequency cut-off>/_lp_<low frequency cut off>/_fwhm_<kernel_fwhm>.  At the lowest level of these subdirectories are smoothed NifTI files.

Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) - Analyze the connectivity between brain regions.
sca_roi_correlation_files, The results of seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from ROIs using 3dTcorr1D.  Results for multiple ROIs are contained in separate files. (?)

sca_seed_correlation_files, The results of seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from seed specifications using 3dTcorr1D.
sca_tempreg_maps_files, The results of multiple regression seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from ROIs.  GLM parameter estimate images for each timeseries in the input file. Results for multiple ROIs are contained in separate files. (?)
sca_tempreg_maps_stack, The results of multiple regression seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from ROIs.  GLM parameter estimate images for each timeseries in the input file. Results for ROIs are concatenated together into a single 4D NifTI file. (?)
