#TODO Find out the names given to derivatives in cpac_pipline.py
<derivative>_zstd, The z-score standardized output for a derivative.
<derivative>_fisher_zstd - The z-score standardized output for a derivative using Fisher's z-score transformation.
output_means, A directory containing a series of nested sub-directories of the following form (with subdirectories representing optional steps only included if those steps were run): _scan_rest/_csf_threshold_<threshold>/_gm_threshold_<threshold>/_wm_threshold_<threshold>/<nuisance_regressors>/_hp_<high frequency cut-off>/_lp_<low frequency cut off>/.  At the lowest level of these subdirectories are text files that contain the average values for each derivative run.  These individual means are also aggregated into a single file of the form 'output_means_<subject name>.csv' in the individua subject output directory.
<derivative>_to_standard, A derivative transformed into MNI space.

Smoothing
<derivative>_smooth,  directory containing a series of nested sub-directories of the following form (with subdirectories representing optional steps only included if those steps were run): _scan_rest/_csf_threshold_<threshold>/_gm_threshold_<threshold>/_wm_threshold_<threshold>/<nuisance_regressors>/_hp_<high frequency cut-off>/_lp_<low frequency cut off>/_fwhm_<kernel_fwhm>.  At the lowest level of these subdirectories are smoothed NifTI files.
