Troubleshooting and Help
------------------------

C-PAC is alpha software, which means that it is still under active development and has not yet undergone large-scale testing. As such, although we have done our best to ensure a stable pipeline, there may still be a few bugs that we did not catch.
 

If you find a bug, would like to request a new feature, or have a question that is not answered in the User Guide, please visit `GitHub Issues page for CPAC <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues>`_.
