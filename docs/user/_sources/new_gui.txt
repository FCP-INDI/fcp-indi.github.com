Try Our New GUI!
================

**February 4, 2019 -** We are in the process of developing a completely new graphical user interface (GUI) for C-PAC! In order to bring the best user experience for you, we are debuting the first stages of the new functionality- the pipeline configuration creator/editor. 

This new interface is distributed apart from the main C-PAC package, and it works without requiring to install C-PAC and its dependencies on your system.

This is a work in progress, and we aim to improve the usability, so any feedback is welcomed! We would **greatly** appreciate it if you let us know your thoughts and suggestions in this `feedback form <https://goo.gl/forms/bBco4bJ1tYcautZ82>`_.
