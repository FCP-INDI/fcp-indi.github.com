Timeseries Extraction
---------------------
C-PAC lets users easily export BOLD timeseries in a number of different ways. This can be useful for those wishing to undertake advanced analysis not include in C-PAC, but still take advantage of its robust pre-processing features.

ROI Timeseries Extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ROI Timeseries Extraction allows you export the timeseries for one or more regions of interest (ROIs). This is done by calculating the avearge timeseries across all voxels within an ROI. As such, C-PAC will output one timeseries for each ROI specified by the user.

When an ROI is placed within a functionally homogeneous area, averaging signals in this way can produce a timecourse which may more accurately reflect the overall activity pattern in the region than does the timeseries of any individual voxel. 

Voxel Timeseries Extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Voxel Timeseries Extraction will export the individual timeseries of all voxels within one or more masks.

Vertex Timeseries Extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Voxel Timeseries Extraction uses FreeSurfer to generate a 2-dimensional model of the cortical surface. Activation data is transformed and registered to points (vertices) on the surface model, each with its own activation timeseries. These timeseries can then be extracted. 

Output Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Timeseries can be exported as either a standard .csv file or as a `Numpy Array <http://scipy-lectures.github.com/intro/numpy/array_object.html?`_
