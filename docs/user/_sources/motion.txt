Motion Correction
-----------------
Movement during scanning is one of of the largest factors influencing the quality of fMRI data. Movement of the head between the acquisition of each volume can cause brain images to become misaligned. Head motion during scanning can also cause in spurious changes in in signal intensity. If they are not corrected, these changes can influence the results of activation and connectivity analysis. Recent studies have shown that motion as small as 0.1mm can systematically bias both within- and between- group effects during the analysis of fMRI data (Power et al., 2011; Satterhwaite et al., 2012; Van Dijk et al., 2012). Even the most cooperative subjects often still show displacements of up to a millimeter, and head movements of several millimeters are not uncommon in studies of hyperkinetic subjects such as young children, older adults, or patient populations.

There are three main approaches to motion correction: volume realignment, censoring of motion confounded time points (i.e. "scrubbing"), and using a general linear model to regress out motion-related artifacts (i.e. regression of motion parameters).

Volume Realignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Volume realignment aligns reconstructed volumes by calculating 6 motion parameters (three translation and three rotation) based on a solid-body model of the head and brain (Friston 1996). Based on these pareameters, each volume is registered to the volume preceeding it.

Scrubbing 
^^^^^^^^^
The most effective way to ensure that your results are have not been influenced by spurious, motion-related noise is to remove volumes during which significant movement occurred. This is known as volume censoring, or Scrubbing. 
Power and colleagues (2011) proposed two measures to identify volumes contaminated by excessive motion– framewise displacement (FD) and DVARS:

* FD is calculated from derivatives of the six rigid body realignment parameters estimated during standard volume realignment, and is a compressed single index of the six realignment parameters.

* DVARS is the root mean squared (RMS) change in BOLD signal from volume to volume (D referring to temporal derivative of time courses and VARS referring to RMS variance over voxels). DVARS is calculated by first differentiating the volumetric time series and then calculating the RMS signal change over the whole brain. This measure indexes the change rate of BOLD signal across the entire brain at each frame of data or, in other words, how much the intensity of a brain image changes relative to the previous time point.  

Together, these two measures capture the head displacements and the brain-wide BOLD signal displacements from volume to volume over all voxels within the brain (Power et al., 2011).

After calculating FD and DVARS, thresholds can be applied to censor the data. Selecting thresholds for Scrubbing is a trade-off. More stringent thresholds allow more complete removal of motion-contaminated data, and minimize motion-induced artifacts. Meanwhile, more stringent Scrubbing will also remove more data, which may increase the variability and decrease the test-retest reliability of the data. Commonly used thresholds are FD > 0.2 to 0.5 mm and DVARS > 0.3 to 0.5% of BOLD.

**IMPORTANT:** Removing time points from a continuous time series (as is done during Scrubbing) disrupts the temporal structure of the data and precludes frequency-based analyses such as `ALFF/fAlff <alff>`_. However, Scrubbing can effectively be used to minimize motion-related artifacts in seed-based correlation analyses (Power et al., 2011; 2012).


Regression of Motion Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Another approach to motion corretion is to regress-out the effects of motion when running statistical analysis. This is done by calculating motion parameters and including them in your General Linear Model (Fox et al., 2005; Weissenbacher et al., 2009).

C-PAC can calculate a number of different sets of motion parameters: 

* **6-Parameter Model** - The three translation and three rotation parameters calculated during volume realignment, as described in Friston 1996.

* **Power Motion Parameters** - Framewise Displacement and DVARS (as described above and in Power et al., 2011)

* **Friston 24-Parameter Model** - The 6 motion parameters of the current volume and the preceeding volume, plus each of these values squared. If the Friston Parameter workflow is enabled, these 24 parameters will be used during volume realignment, instead of the usual 6.

Viewing Motion Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To view motion parameters generated by C-PAC, `download <https://raw.github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/master/tools/extract_parameters.py>`_ the :file:`extract_parameters.py` script. Navigate to your main C-PAC output directory and run it by typing::

    python extract_parameters.py /path/to/output/directory

Where :file:`/path/to/output/directory` is the path to your output directory (:file:`outputDirectory` as specified in :file:`config.yml`). This will output a :file:`...all_params.csv` file in the top level of each pipeline directory which contains all motion parameters calculated by C-PAC.

Configuring C-PAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Volume realignment is run automatically during functional preprocessing.

The following settings in :file:`config.yml` are used to configure Scrubbing::

    # Generate FD and DVARS motion statistics
    # Required to run scrubbing, but can also be used as regressors in a GLM
    runGenerateMotionStatistics = [1]

    # Run Scrubbing
    runScrubbing = [0]

    # Specify maximum acceptable Framewise Displacement (in mm)
    # Any volume with displacement greater than this value will be removed.
    scrubbingThreshold = [0.2]

    # Number of volumes to remove prior to a volume with excessive FD
    numRemovePrecedingFrames = 1

    # Number of volumes to remove following a volume with excessive FD
    numRemoveSubsequentFrames = 2

To generate paramters to include in your GLM, enable the folloiwng workflows::

    # Generate FD and DVARS motion statistics
    # Required to run scrubbing, but can also be used as regressors in a GLM
    runGenerateMotionStatistics = [1]

    # Generate motion statistics based on the 24 parameter Friston model.
    runFristonModel = [1]
