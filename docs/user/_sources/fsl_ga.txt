Setting Up Group-Level Statistics
---------------------------------

Enter Phenotypic Information and Other Regressors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open the :file:`template_phenotypic.csv` file generated by previously when you ran :file:`extract_data`. Create a column for each phenotypic variable or regressor you would like included in your model, and enter the appropriate value for each subject. When you are finished, save your changes.

Configure FSL Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open :file:`config_fsl.py`. Enter the regressors you would like to include, the path to :file:`template_phenotypic.csv`, and a name for the .csv model file to be output. Save your changes.

Run FSL Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open iPython and type::
    import CPAC
    CPAC.utils.create_fsl_model.run ('/path/to/config_fsl_py', 'generate_model_csv')

This will output a .csv model file with the name you specified.

Reconfigure FSL Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Based on the columns you have included in your model, create a contrast file using FSL. Specify the location of this file in :file:`config_fsl.py`, as well as a name for the model.

Run FSL Script Again
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open iPython and type::
    import CPAC
    create_fsl_model.run ('/path/to/config_fsl_py', 'generate_model_fsl_files')

This will output the standard FSL model files in the directory from which the script is run. You may then specify the location of these files in :file:`config.py`, and :doc:`run the C-PAC group pipeline </use>`.
