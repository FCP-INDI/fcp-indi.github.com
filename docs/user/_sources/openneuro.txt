Running C-PAC on OpenNeuro
==========================

The `OpenNeuro <https://openneuro.org>`_ project is an initiative to provide easy access to public neuroimaging datasets and the ability to quickly run analysis pipelines on these datasets directly through a web interface. C-PAC is available as an app on OpenNeuro, and more information on running apps on the platform is available `here <https://openneuro.org/faq>`_.
