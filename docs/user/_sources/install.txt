Installing CPAC
----------------

Installation Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This page will guide you through the following steps required to install CPAC:

* Installing the required Python dependencies (either manually or through Canopy).
* Installing Nibabel and Nipype.
* Installing AFNI and FSL.
* Installing required CPAC Image Resources.
* Installing CPAC itself.

It will also provide information on how to:

* Test your installation.
* Upgrade CPAC to a new version.
* Run CPAC without installing.


System Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CPAC is **designed to run in a Unix-like environment** such as Linux or Mac OS X, and thus does not support Windows.

Although CPAC should run on most computers made in the past few years, **we highly recommend using a system with multiple cores or multiple processors**, as many of the analyses carried out by CPAC are computationally intensive. As a general rule, CPAC will run on any machine capable of reliably running `AFNI <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni>`_ or `FSL <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/>`_.

A Note About the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**This User Guide assumes a basic level of experience using the command line.** If you are new to the command line (also known as the terminal), the resources below can help you get started.

Platform Specific Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following instructions provide additional information about the peculiarities of installing CPAC and it's dependencies on various operating systems.

**Mac OS X:** 

* Before installing python dependencies, please download and install the `Xcode Command Line Tools from Apple <https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action>`_ (requires a free Apple account).
* Manually installing SciPy and NumPy on OS X can be difficult. We therefore strongly recommend you use Anaconda. 
* If you are using Anaconda: After running the wxPython installer, you must manually copy the ``wxdirect.pth`` file from ``/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/`` to ``~/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/``.


**Ubuntu, Debian, and NeuroDebian:**

* FSL and AFNI should be installed through ``apt`` from the `NeuroDebian Repository <http://neuro.debian.net/>`_ (make sure you select "all software" from the options under Get NeuroDebian)
* wxPython should also be installed through ``apt``.

Install Python Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python is the glue (Bloom, 2012) that ties all the pieces of CPAC together. Though many computers come with Python pre-installed, CPAC relies on a number of special-purpose packages, which are listed below. Packages with an asterisk (*) can be installed through `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/easy_install.html>`_ by running the command ``easy_install package`` (for example, ``easy_install networkx``).

* `SciPy and NumPy <http://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_ 
* `NetworkX <http://networkx.lanl.gov/>`_ * (``easy_install networkx``)
* `Traits <https://github.com/enthought/traits>`_ * (``easy_install traits``)
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ * (``easy_install matplotlib``)
* `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org/>`_
* `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML>`_ * (``easy_install pyyaml``)
* `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/intro/#installation>`_ * (``easy_install jinja2``)
* `PyLockfile <https://code.google.com/p/pylockfile/>`_ * (``easy_install lockfile``)
* `iPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ (optional)
* `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ (optional; required for workflow graphs)

**Tip:** It is possible to install many of these packages (all but Traits, PyLockfile, and wxPython) automatically by using the free `Anaconda Python Environment <https://store.continuum.io/>`_. If you chose to use Anaconda, you must download the **64-bit version**.

Install Nibabel and Nipype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CPAC relies heavily on tools developed as part of the `Neuroimaging in Python project <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipy/stable/index.html>`_. Specifically, `Nipype <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipype/>`_ and `Nibabel <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/>`_ must be installed for CPAC to run.

To install Nibabel, run the command ``easy_install nibabel``.

To install Nipype, you must first download a custom build from the `FCP-INDI GitHub page <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/nipype/>`_. For a direct download, `click here <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/nipype/archive/master.tar.gz>`_.

Open a terminal window and unpack the file using the following command::

    tar -xzvf filename.tar.gz

Where :file:`filename.tar.gz` is the name of the file you just downloaded.

This will result in a new directory containing Nipype files. Navigate to this directory and run the following command to install Nipype::

    python setup.py install


Install AFNI and FSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CPAC harnesses the power of two leading neuroimaging software packages (`AFNI <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/>`_ and `FSL <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/>`_) to perform key analyses. These packages must be installed before running CPAC. 

For instructions on how to install AFNI, `click here <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/HOWTO/howto/ht00_inst/html/>`_. Downloading AFNI should take approximately 5 minutes on a standard broadband connection. **Mac Users:** If you are using OS X 10.7 or greater, we recommend doing a 

For instructions on how to install FSL, `click here <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation>`_. Users should ensure they download and install FSL -5.0. Downloading FSL should take approximately 15 minutes on a standard broadband connection. 

**Mac OS X:**

* FSL - Follow the instructions on the `FSL Download Page <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fsldownloadmain.html>`_.
* AFNI - Follow the instructions to do a `Basic Install <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/HOWTO/howto/ht00_inst/html/mac_10.78.html>`_.

**Ubuntu and NeuroDebian:**

* FSL - ``apt-get install fsl-5.0``
* AFNI - ``apt-get install afni``


Check AFNI and FSL Paths
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Application paths for AFNI and FSL should have been added to your user profile when they were installed, but it is useful to double-check this before continuing (as the absence of these paths is a common cause of CPAC errors). If the application paths have been set properly, you should be able to open AFNI and FSL by running the commands ``afni`` and ``fsl`` in a new terminal window.

If either of these commands fail, you will have to add the AFNI and FSL application paths manually. To do this, run the command ``nano ~/.bashrc``. This will open your :file:`.bashrc` file in the `nano text editor <http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/reu/nano.html>`_. Scroll to the bottom of the file (navigate using the arrow keys on your keyboard) and paste the following text::

    # Path to FSL
    FSLDIR=/path/to/fsl
    . ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh
    PATH=${FSLDIR}/bin:${PATH}
    export FSLDIR PATH

    # Path to AFNI
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/afni
    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/afni

Where :file:`/path/to/fsl` and :file:`/path/to/afni` are the locations where FSL and AFNI are installed (by default, these are :file:`/usr/local/fsl` for FSL and :file:`~/abin` for AFNI). When you have added the paths, save your changes (control + O) and exit nano (control + X).

**Mac Users:** You must also add these paths to your :file:`.bash_profile` file. Simply follow the same instructions above but replace ``nano ~/.bashrc`` with ``nano ~/.bash_profile``.

**tcsh Users:** Add these paths to your ``.cshrc`` file.

To confirm that the changes have worked, open a new terminal window and try again to open AFNI and FSL.


Install CPAC Image Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
During preprocessing and analysis, CPAC utilizes many of the standard brain atlases and tissue maps provided by FSL. Additionally, CPAC requires the following non-standard files in order to run properly.

* Binarized tissue prior probability maps (used during :doc:`tissue segmentation </anat>`)
* Symmetric versions of the MNI152 brain template and masks (used when calculating :doc:`VMHC </vmhc>`)

These files are included in the CPAC Image Resources package, available `for download here <http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cpac_image_resources.zip>`_. As above, this file can be unpacked by running the ``tar -xzvf`` command. 

Included in the package is a ``install_resources.sh`` script that when run will copy the resource files to your FSL directory (which is where CPAC looks for them by default). To run this script, navigate to the CPAC Image Resources directory and run the command ``sudo bash install_resources.sh``.

Users wishing to manually install these files can do so by following the directions below.

* Files located in the :file:`/symmetric` folder of the CPAC Image Resources directory should be copied to the :file:`/data/standard` directory of your FSL installation.

* The :file:`/2mm` and :file:`/3mm` folders located in CPAC Image Resources directory should be copied to :file:`/data/standard/tissuepriors` directory of your FSL installation.


Install CPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Congratulations, you are now ready to install CPAC itself!

CPAC is available for download from the `CPAC Homepage <http://fcp-indi.github.com/>`_. Click the button labeled "Download as tar.gz". As above, unpack the downloaded archive and navigate to the new directory. To install CPAC, run the command ``python setup.py install``. CPAC will be installed alongside your other python packages. 


Test CPAC Installation
""""""""""""""""""""""
In a new terminal window, open iPython (or Python) and enter the command ``import CPAC``. If installation was successful, this will execute without an error and present you with a blank new line. If you encounter an error (e.g. ``no module named CPAC``), try re-running the CPAC install command above. If this does not work, see the :doc:`Troubleshooting and Help Page </help>`.

Once you are able to successfully ``import CPAC`` it is safe to delete any setup files downloaded during the install process (e.g. Nipype and CPAC downloads, FSL install scripts, etc.), as they are no longer needed.

**Note:** The test process described here only acts to confirm that the CPAC python package has been correctly installed. To fully test CPAC on your system, please see the :doc:`Benchmark Page </benchmark>`.

Updating CPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CPAC is being actively developed, and new versions (containing bug fixes and new features) are released approximately once a month. To update to the latest version, simply download it from the `CPAC Homepage <http://fcp-indi.github.com/>`_ and repeat the instructions in the "Install CPAC" section above. A list of previous versions and the changes they contain is available on the :doc:`Release Notes Page </rnotes>`.

Running CPAC Without Installing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users wishing to run CPAC without installing it can do so by copying the downloaded CPAC directory to the location of their choice. CPAC can then be run by opening iPython (or Python) from within this directory. This is useful in cases where a user does not have sufficient privledges to install Python packages, but is running on a machine that already contains all CPAC dependencies.

**Note:** Unfortunately, it is not possible at this time to use the CPAC GUI without installing CPAC.
