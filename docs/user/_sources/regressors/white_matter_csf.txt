Signal changes in the white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) primarily reflect non-neural fluctuations such as scanner instabilities, subject motion, and physiological artifacts (e.g. respiration and cardiac effects) (Dagli et al., 1999; Windischberger et al., 2002). These signals are largely independent from the BOLD signal fluctuations recorded in gray matter, and may introduce temporal coherences that lead to an overestimation of functional connectivity strength. Successful estimation and correction for this non-neural noise allows for the exclusion such confounding effects.
