Preconfigured Files
-------------------
Working With Preconfigured Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We provide preconfigured versions of two files, :file:`data_config.py` (used to define file structure templates when generating subject lists) and :file:`scan_parameters.csv` (used when running :doc:`Slice Timing Correction </slice>`) for use with key `INDI <http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/>`_ data releases. While the preconfigured :file:`scan_parameters.csv` files can be used unmodified, it is necessary to slightly edit the file structure templates in :file:`data_config.py` before they can be used.

File structure templates in preconfigured copies of :file:`data_config.py` will be prefixed with the text :file:`/path/to/data`. This is because though we are able to pre-define the folder structure of INDI releases, there is no way for us to know where exactly the data will be located on your specific system. Users must replace :file:`/path/to/data` with the path to the data files downloaded from INDI. For example, if you have downloaded the `ABIDE <http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/>`_ data set and placed the files in an :file:`/ABIDE` directory loaced in your :file:`/home/science/` folder, you would replace :file:`/path/to/data` with :file:`/home/science/ABIDE`.
