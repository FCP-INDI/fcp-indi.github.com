Release Notes
-------------

Version 0.3.1 Alpha - 2013.09.13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. A range of improvements to the GUI and its operation.

#. Extended improvements to group analysis operation.

#. Error fix: custom FSL-FNIRT configuration files can now successfully be provided to CPAC.

#. Error fix: CPAC setup.py would not fully overwrite old files - setup.py now works correctly and also creates a backup folder with the old CPAC install directory.

#. Addition of some more informative and user-friendly error messages and user warnings.

#. CPAC pipeline configuration file renamed from config.yml to pipeline_config.yml.

#. Group analysis function update: the ability to classify EVs as either categorical or continuous has been temporarily removed as we continue our ongoing process of refining CPAC's group analysis model builder. The user must now provide a phenotypic file (.csv format) with categorical EVs broken out into dummy variables.

Version 0.1.9 Alpha - 2013.03.18
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) feature: Dual Regression for Spatial Maps and ROIs
2) feature/issue120: Flexibility with multiple models and model-specific subject list
3) feature/issue157: Condor cluster job submission support
4) fix/issue108: (re)check output directory when pipeline is run again
5) fix/issue147: Split up covariates if create_fsl_model.py when modeling group variances seperately
6) fix/issue139: Rename "sink" directory to "output" directory

Version 0.1.8 Alpha - 2013.2.20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) Modification- replaced all configuration files(config.py, CPAC_subject_list.py, config_fsl.py, data_config.py) to YAML formats
2) Fix- Ignore empty lines and commented lines in all txt files used as input by CPAC
3) Fix - Configuration files import issue.  
4) Removed confusing directories with numbers for sca roi outputs and centrality outputs. Now all the ROI outputs go into a single directory per subject and same holds centrality outputs


Version 0.1.7 Alpha - 2013.02.05
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) Improved Error message for Removing Working Directory
2) New Centrality Workflow
3) Fixed underscore problem when no session in the data
4) FSL model file generator tool : one run, improved error reporting, multicollinearity detection
5) ROI , mask and template spefications are now files instead of directories
6) Anatomical and Functional Data can now be registered to different standard resolution templates
7) Subject processed fully notification after the subject pipeline finishes


Version 0.1.6 Alpha - 2013.01.21
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) Fix logger in extract_data.py tool
2) Nuisance code Refactoring
3) Fixed ROI names in SCA
4) Added Import for create_fsl_model in local __init__.py
5) Added New Pipeline names
6) Fixed Pipeline Naming bug when package is installed
7) Centrality fix to handle NAN correlation values
8) Generate ROI nifti files using user co-ordinates
9) Fix output directory structure to handle multiple model run with single subject list
10) Fix in Group Analysis, to get 4D EPI as per input subject list
11) Boundary Based Registration becomes the default registration
12) New Alff/fAlff workflow
13) Updates in config file to accomodate new features
14) Fix to append unit of time(in TR) in slice timing correction: get_scan_parameters
15) Minor changes in create_fsl_model : replace '#' in output csv name with '__'
16) Feature addition to clear subject level working directory
17) Added Exception to handle missing dependancy for pygraphviz
18) Added extract_parameters.py script to consolidate motion parameters


Version 0.1.1 Alpha - 2012.10.15
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Scrubbing:** Users can now specify the number of TRs that should be removed before and after an offending TR.

* **Scrubbing:** C-PAC now prints a warning specifying the number of time points left after scrubbing. If no time points are left, C-PAC will crash and print an error.

* **Slice Timing:** Users can now specify which sites are run with slice timing correction.

* **Slice Timing:** Slice timing correction is now able to read slice timing information directly from an image file, and works on Multiband sequences.

* **Timeseries:** Users can now specify a different number of initial TRs to be removed for each site.

* **Data Config:** Data extraction now works for the NKI-TRT data set, and automatically extracts scan parameters for each subject from the image file.

* **Fix:** C-PAC no longer crashes if dot is not installed. Instead, it prints an error and contines running.
