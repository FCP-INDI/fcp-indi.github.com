Do you want to retain all intermediate files?
#############################################

C-PAC stores all of the pipeline's intermediate files in a Nipype-managed working directory. Retaining intermediate files means saving your working directory.

Pros

* Allows you to restart the pipeline from where it left off (re-runs from a particular point, pausing, errors/crashes).
* Retains all provenance information - exactly what was run, which files went into each node/tool, which files came out. This is also essential for debugging, if necessary.

Cons

* Uses a large amount of disk space.

- Yes
    - [link to --save_working_dir SSOT info or add it into the run command example]
- No
