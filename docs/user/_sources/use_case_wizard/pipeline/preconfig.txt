- I want to run one of the pre-configured pipelines
    - Anat only (maybe make the simple ones their own level, above)
        - [link the --preconfig anat-only flag from SSOT]
    - fmriprep+XCP
        - [small blurb explaining - can pull from SSOT, but not the entire write-up- maybe have 2-3 levels of resolution for the docs]
    - monkey / rodent NHP (later)
    - etc.
