.. title:: C-PAC 1.7 → 1.8 pipeline configuration mappings

The C-PAC pipeline configuration was changed to a nested format with import capabilities in v1.8.0.

If you provide C-PAC v1.8 with a pipeline configuration file in the v1.7 format, C-PAC will attempt to update the pipeline for you, creating a directory called ``updated_config`` within your output directory, and including the following files:
   
   * the updated pipeline configuration file, with the same name as the original pipeline configuration file
   * the original pipeline configuration file, suffixed with a timestamp and ``.bak``
   * any keys from the original pipeline configuration file that were not updated, suffixed with ``.rem``

Please be sure to check that the updated pipeline configuration file configures the pipeline as intended.

The following keys are deprecated:

.. include:: /references/1.7-1.8-deprecations.rst


The following YAML is formatted such that the keys are the pipeline configuration keys in C-PAC ≤ v1.7 and the values are a list of successively deeper keys in a C-PAC 1.8 pipeline configuration. For example,
    .. code-block:: YAML

       pipelineName:
         - pipeline_setup
         - pipeline_name
    
    indicates the change, from 1.7

    .. code-block:: YAML

       pipelineName: pipline-name_value
    
    to 1.8

    .. code-block:: YAML

       pipeline_setup:
          pipeline_name: pipeline-name_value

The full list of mappings is as follows:
