.. topic:: Neuroparc v1.0: Baseline

  On July 20, 2020, Neuroparc released v1.0. In moving from v0 to v1, the paths to several of the Neuroparc atlases changed. The atlases are used by C-PAC in its default and preconfigured pipelines. C-PAC v1.7.0 includes the Neuroparc v1.0 paths, but **if you are using a pipeline based on C-PAC 1.6.2a or older, you will need to update any Nueroparc v0 paths in your config**

  .. csv-table:: All paths begin with ``/ndmg_atlases/label/Human/``
    :header: "Neuroparc v0","Neuroparc v1"
