.. title:: C-PAC 1.7 → 1.8 pipeline configuration mappings

The following YAML is formatted such that the keys are the pipeline configuration keys in C-PAC ≤ 1.7 and the values are a list of successively deeper keys in a C-PAC 1.8 pipeline configuration. For example,
    .. code-block:: YAML

       pipelineName:
         - pipeline_setup
         - pipeline_name
    
    indicates the change, from 1.7

    .. code-block:: YAML

       pipelineName: pipline-name_value
    
    to 1.8

    .. code-block:: YAML

       pipeline_setup:
          pipeline_name: pipeline-name_value

The following keys are deprecated:

    * ``TR``
    * ``fdCalc``
    * ``reGenerateOutputs``
    * ``runMedianAngleCorrection``
    * ``slice_timing_pattern``
    * ``targetAngleDeg``
    * ``runSymbolicLinks``

See :ref:`Regressors specification <nuisance-no-gui>` to manually update any of the following keys:

     * ``nComponents``
     * ``nuisanceBandpassFreq``
     * ``numRemovePrecedingFrames``
     * ``numRemoveSubsequentFrames``
     * ``runFrequencyFiltering``
     * ``runFristonModel``
     * ``runMotionSpike``
     * ``spikeThreshold``

The full list of mappings is as follows:
